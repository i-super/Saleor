<p>Are you sure you want to delete staff member {{ staff }}?</p>
<p>Deleting staff member also removes him from customer list and removes all his related data (orders, payment etc.).</p>
<p>We strongly recommend not deleting user accounts that were used for purchases (for example customer which was promoted with staff member status).</p>
