1. Install it in development mode:

   ```
   $ python setup.py develop
   ```
   (For production use `python setup.py install` instead.)
1. Add a `SECRET_KEY` to your `settings.py` (we did not want to include one out of fear that you'd forget to change it)
1. Prepare the database:

   ```
   $ saleor syncdb --all
   ```
1. Run `saleor runserver`ยน to start the development server (on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/))
1. Edit the code to have it suite your requirements
1. Run the tests to make sure everything works:

ยน `saleor` is a shortcut for running `python manage.py` so you can use it to execute all management commands.
