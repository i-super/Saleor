Thumbnails
==========

Saleor uses `VersatileImageField <https://github.com/respondcreate/django-versatileimagefield>`_ replacement for Django's ImageField.
For performance reasons, in non-debug mode thumbnails are pregenerated by the worker's task, fired after saving the instance.
Accessing missing image will result in 404 error.

In debug mode thumbnails are generated on demand.


Generating Products Thumbnails Manually
---------------------------------------

Create missing thumbnails for all ProductImage instances.

.. code-block:: console

 $ python manage.py create_thumbnails


Deleting Image Renditions
-------------------------

Image renditions are not deleted automatically with the main image, however Saleor handles that on ``post_delete`` model's signal.
More on deleting rendition images can be found in `VersatileImageField documentation <https://django-versatileimagefield.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deleting_created_images.html>`_
