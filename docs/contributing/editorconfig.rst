EditorConfig
============

The root of the repository contains an `EditorConfig <http://editorconfig.org/>`_ file.

Most editors and IDEs support this file either directly or via plugins. If you make sure that your programming environment respects the contents of this file you will automatically get correct indentation, encoding, and line endings.
